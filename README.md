# Sun Haven Mod - Remote Earthquake and Rain Cloud

Select a remote tile and cast the spell.

## Overview

This mod fires Earthquake and Rain Cloud at a selected tile in a remote location. Very quick players have difficulty standing in the exact center of the field, but selecting a tile and remotely casting a spell eliminates the need to fine-tune the standing position.

Remote Earthquake is casted by holding down Left Ctrl key and clicking with a Hoe. While the Ctrl key is held down, the tool's range is extended and the tile selection square effect can be displayed at a distance.

Remote Rain Cloud is casted by holding down Left Ctrl key and clicking with a Watering Can. Rain clouds move in the direction they are fired, so you need to be careful about the positional relationship between the player and the tile.

To use remote spells, you will need to unlock the corresponding skills. (Farming Tier‡X Row1st Earthquake and Farming Tier‡Z Row1st Rain Cloud)
