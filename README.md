# Sun Haven Mod - Remote Earthquake and Rain Cloud

Select a remote tile and cast the spell.

## Overview

This mod fires Earthquake and Rain Cloud at a selected tile in a remote location. Very quick players have difficulty standing in the exact center of the field, but selecting a tile and remotely casting a spell eliminates the need to fine-tune the standing position.

Remote Earthquake is casted by holding down Left Ctrl key and clicking with a Hoe. Remote Rain Cloud is casted by holding down Left Ctrl key and clicking with a Watering Can.

While holding down Ctrl key, the effective area of the spell becomes visible.

To use remote spells, you will need to unlock the corresponding skills. (Farming Tier5 Row1st Earthquake and Farming Tier7 Row1st Rain Cloud)
